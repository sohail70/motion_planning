                About the following if:
                This trick actually enables us to only track changes in the update obstalce otherwise we have to use the 
                current nodes instead of added in the handle add obstalce or the other way is to check all the edges around 
                added obstalce for obstalce

                I also added this feature to rrtx so we have a fair comparison between these two if we use ignore_sample==true 

                to give some information when we use ignore_sample we are actually ignoring to update the nodes around obstalce. 
                the nodes that we ignore is the minimum amount of nodes that is essential based on the worst case formula:

                sqrt(radius of obstalce ^2 + (max_length/2)^2 ) 

                why max_length/2 ?? because the worst case happens when an edge is tangent to the circle obstalce and half of edge is on the upper semicricle and half is down
                imagine the left is max_edge and the right is a circle

                    |â—¯

                Now using Pythagorean Theorem you can find the amount of length you need to provide for the kd tree radius search to include at least one of those nodes
                Other if that line is slightly up the lower node will be catched by the kd tree radius search

                the first condition below is from fmt 
                and the second is what i added to enable rewiring
                the second if is mainly gonna be used when we remove obstalce
                other wise when we addObstacle we specifically find the nodes that we should put in vUnvisited because before
                adding obstacle we have a tree and we can find the descendant using depth first search to orphan all the affected nodes
                but when we remove obstacle we can only put the direct nodes that are now off the obstacle into vunvisited and put their surrounding into vopen
                and rely on the second condition below to correct the nodes as we go downstream
                There is an important concept that you need to understand that there is a fundamental difference between adding obstacle and removing obstacle
                I explained this in the handleAddobstalce function but one thing you need to know is when adding obstacle the leaf nodes might get connected to other side branches 
                (the plier example) but in remove obstalce its not happening because remove obstalce surely reduces cost for some nodes so the update down stream surely connect to the branch
                thats being updated through the immediate nodes that are now free of obstacle. but in add obstalce the cost for some nodes is gonna go up so they might decide to attach themselves 
                to other branches to have a lower cost

                10K nodes static env using dynamic_world.sdf without hitting play and commenting the update function and the static plan before the loop: and making the simulation is pause false
                    checks: 8989
                    Time taken for the update : 786 milliseconds
               
                and with using the second condtion:
                    checks: 8989
                    Time taken for the update : 798 milliseconds

                so it took the same amount! so no burden in the static case. I also tested 1000 and 500 nodes and they both took the same amount
                I thought maybe it would add a little burden of rewiring the already updated nodes in the static case but it didn't maybe because 
                Well i guess the reason is that condtion also relies on z node which we are losing as we go. I thought maybe this condtion would
                help the lack of ability of fmt to completely find optimal solution in low sample case but it doesnt which is good at least i don't
                have to worry about theretical stuff and that condtion serves its purpose in the remove obstacle case.

                Also on another note mind that we are not assigning the nodes that satisfy the second condtion to anything or obsolete them beforhand so they are either getting updated or keep their last parent/cost/children
                this might create confusion but if you think about it its okay! to give an exmaple imgaine second if condtion is satisfied for some node that has a parent and children
                and then it gets to be updated in the cost update procedure after obstalce check. then one should setParent either to a new parent or its old parent (the old parent also happens but obviously the cost of that parent has changed beforehand)
                setParent takes care of connecting the x node to the newParent and remove that x as the child of old parent but how about x's children?
                x node obviously might have had some children that we are not removing! but we don't need to because as the update goes the setParent takes care of those mentioned children one by one
                because they are downstream nodes and they get updated any way on the next z node pop and update procedure, UNTIL you reach the robot and then you might see some inconsistency (visually) that happens after that
                which is also okay because if you move the robot using MOUSE in gazebo you can see they also CAN get updated but we don't need to update that because we are using early exit!

/*
    The procedure is like this depending on if you use ignore_sample to ignore all the samples around obstalce (based on the minimum amounf formula)
    if you ignore sample everything is easy and you don't need obstalce check in handle add and handle remove obstalce
    we can alse use added/removed wrt to the previous 
    imagine two circles that have an intersection the left one is previous position of the upstacle and the right is the new position
    also try to visulize them bigger because of the findSampleNewObstalce that has overestimate formula (which i emphasize agian is the minimum needed for the worst case scenraio)
    now the right crescent would be the "added" nodes and the left crescent would be the "removed" nodes and every thing in between is not necessary to be in update because they are 
    on samples_in_obstalces and we ignore them in the plan function

    the approach of ignoring samples is good but as the number of samples lowers the overestimate formula gets bigger because max_edge gets bigger so we end up ignoring lots of sample (so we are sacrificing optimality)
    even though its optimal for samples that we provide to the plan but since we ignore some samples so the plan() function doesnt see them
    but all in all we can say its much faster than to explicitly check and as the number of nodes increases that problem becomes negligible to non existent i would say although i need to provide some math maybe

    if i want to give some comparison between rrtx and fmtx in ignore sample case --> it would be a fight between incremental rewiring and batch repair! because if we use ignore_sample==true there would be absolutely no obstalce check
    and you can see as we lower the rate of the outer main while loop the batch update outperforms and as we increase the rate we see  they are both on par algorithms.
    to give more explanation lower rate (like 1hz) means the obstalce move alot and suddenly lots of nodes gets orphaned and fmtx shines

    but if we follow rrtx approach to explicitly check edges because why do we ignore useful samples! then we have to use complete current sample and complete previous samples 
    and we explicitly check obstalce for each node and its neighbor to find which of the overestimated node are indeed have an edge on obstalce and which don't

        one might ask why do you put orphan nodes into v_unvisited_set when you have a mechanism in the main loop to find these automatically?! 
        The reason is these help the finding of the v open nodes later in the update obstalce sample function
        If we only rely on that mechansim we can't find connections to other branches because we are blind to see other branches! like on the other side of the tree
        Imagine the one side of the plier and some nodes get better cost if they get connected to the other tip of the plier but since we didn't put the other side nodes into v open we never know!

        (side note: Also imagine if the the two tips of the the plier is far apart so you can't rely on the neighborhood raidus of one side to get to the other!)

        So that condtion in the main loop is just for one direction expansion and is good for the nodes that gor removed from the obstalce--> Although its a reasonable question here also to ask ourselves why its not the case
        for the remove obstlace to now know their v open at first!
        the difference between addObstalce and removeObstalce is adding and obstalce most certainly adds cost to orphan nodes
        but removing an obstlace most certainly reduces cost of the neighbor nodes! and reducing happens in the current branch and direction of the expansion that happens in dijkstra like (like fmtx) algorithm 
        so we don't need to worry about the other side of plier (per say!) because they are gonna connect to us! not us connecting to them (and by "us" i mean the current direction of the expansion)

        UPDATE IS WHEN A COST of node has changed and that happens only in the main plan function. here we only make the cost to inf and we removed. you may ask
        how can you be sure we don't have any vopen heap nodes left? in partial update false the vopen heap gets fully cleaned because of the while loop but in partial update true
        we early exit that loop so some vopen heap nodes are left! in this scenraio now imagine an obstalce is being added and at the worst case scenario it is being added to the region where there are already vopen heap nodes!
        the result of adding obstalce means two things! ---> some vclosed (conceptually i mean because i don't use vclose in my algorithm!) nodes become vunvisted or some vopen nodes become vunvisted! and the previously vunvisited due to partial update
        stays in vunvisted! mind that the cost of these per say messeup nodes will become infinity or stay infinity
        for expansion we need CORRECT vopen heap nodes! (by correct i mean the correct cost that resembles the changes of the environment) and one rule you need to follow for safety is to not put any vunvisted node into vopen or if some vunvisted node is in vopen you need to remove it
        so since the cost of nodes doesnt change to any numbers but inf! so we only need to remove them. the following addition to heap is also for covering the vunvisted node for the next batch of update in plan function
        in the next for loop i do the heap removal

        but in the plan function since i update the nodes cost because of the second condtion in the main if! i have to update the queue's priority --> and its only happening frequntly in obstalce removal(even though it might sometimes happens in the regular loop due to the main problem that fmt has in low sample number which is negligible when samples counters go to inf theoretically!)
