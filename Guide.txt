FMT⋆ trades more graph/book‑keeping work and more nearest‑neighbor queries for fewer collision checks, whereas RRT⋆ does the opposite.

take the plots based on this commit(because i added some part like obs cache to fmtx or static obstacles cache etc or some parts i cant even remember that causes more performance hit on fmtx which is just optimal to use):

    Default to fmt style delayed obstalce check for replanning (prune==false)


another thing is i didnt know about gz sim -s option that would only run the server without the gui. the plots and comparsions are based on running the full gui. i tested without gui in for example
C=1.5 and 10 obstalce with fmtx and the median result were 10ms faster! but all in all it doesnt matter because both FMTx and RRTx were tested with the same condtions!

////////////////////////////////
The reason your RRTX implementation works without explicit obstacle checks during dynamic updates lies in how you handle node invalidation and rewiring:

Proximity-Based Obstacle Detection:
In updateObstacleSamples, you use findSamplesNearObstacles to detect nodes near obstacles. By invalidating these nodes (setting edge distances to INFINITY), you implicitly mark their connected edges as blocked without explicitly checking every edge. This assumes nodes near obstacles sufficiently represent blocked regions.

Edge Invalidation/Revalidation:

Add Obstacles: Nodes in obstacles invalidate their edges, forcing rewiring to bypass them.

Remove Obstacles: Freed nodes recalculate edge distances (but your code skips obstacle checks and assumes edges are now valid). This works if your obstacle updates are perfect (e.g., Gazebo provides exact obstacle positions).

Rewiring and LMC Updates:
The reduceInconsistency and rewireNeighbors functions propagate cost changes through the tree. Invalidated edges are ignored during rewiring, while valid edges (even if previously blocked) are reconsidered when nodes are freed.

Why It Works Without Explicit Checks:
Implicit Obstacle Avoidance: By marking nodes near obstacles as invalid, their edges are excluded from the tree. The rewiring process naturally avoids these regions.

Dense Sampling: With 5000 nodes, the tree likely covers the space densely enough that most obstacle changes are captured by proximity checks on nodes.

Assumption of Perfect Updates: If Gazebo provides accurate obstacle positions, findSamplesNearObstacles ensures nodes/edges near obstacles are invalidated reliably.

Potential Pitfalls:
False Positives/Negatives: If nodes are incorrectly marked as in-obstacle/free, paths might be invalid.

Edge-Level Obstacles: A new obstacle blocking an edge between two valid nodes (not near either node) might go undetected. Your current implementation assumes such cases are rare due to dense sampling.

For robustness, consider adding edge validity checks in removeObstacle using obs_checker_->isObstacleFree(...) when recalculating distances. This would handle edge-level obstacles not captured by node proximity.

///////////////
Besides the above i think the sole reason is the formula i used in the find samples in obstalce which is a simple euclidean distance by using a the max edge length --> i actually invalidate more nodes than necessary, otherwise i have to explicitly obstalce checking
but that made rrtx very fast and on par with fmtx! :) ---> because we do not explicitly obstalce check anymore but fmtx is still using the plan and obstalce checks! --> which mean fmtx must be faster --> i even didn't use a good tree node for fmtx

serious problem:

Why Aren’t parent_ and children_ Cleared Automatically?
Raw pointers (FMTNode*) have no idea when the object they point to is deleted.

They don’t participate in ownership.

They don’t "know" when tree_.clear() happens.

std::vector<FMTNode*> is just a list of memory addresses.

Clearing tree_ doesn’t magically update these pointers.

Why Clearing tree_ Doesn't Clear parent_ and children_
You’re encountering a classic C++ ownership misconception. Here’s the breakdown:

1. What Happens When You Call tree_.clear()?
tree_ is a std::vector<std::shared_ptr<FMTNode>>

clear() destroys all shared_ptrs in the vector.

If no other shared_ptrs reference the nodes, the FMTNode objects are deleted from memory.

But parent_ and children_ are raw pointers (FMTNode*)

They are non-owning: They don’t keep the referenced nodes alive.

After tree_.clear(), these pointers become dangling (pointing to freed memory).

Example:
cpp
Copy
auto node1 = std::make_shared<FMTNode>(...);  // node1 owns the FMTNode
auto node2 = std::make_shared<FMTNode>(...);  // node2 owns another FMTNode

// Set raw pointer links
node1->children_.push_back(node2.get());  // node1's children_ points to node2's memory
node2->parent_ = node1.get();             // node2's parent_ points to node1's memory

tree_.push_back(node1);
tree_.push_back(node2);

tree_.clear();  // node1 and node2 are deleted, but:
// node1->children_[0] is now a dangling pointer!
// node2->parent_ is now a dangling pointer!
Why Aren’t parent_ and children_ Cleared Automatically?
Raw pointers (FMTNode*) have no idea when the object they point to is deleted.

They don’t participate in ownership.

They don’t "know" when tree_.clear() happens.

std::vector<FMTNode*> is just a list of memory addresses.

Clearing tree_ doesn’t magically update these pointers.

3. What You Expected vs. What Actually Happens
Your Expectation	Reality
"tree_.clear() should also clear parent_ and children_."	tree_.clear() only deletes the shared_ptrs. Raw pointers in children_/parent_ are left dangling.
"I never used new, so I’m safe."	Raw pointers (FMTNode*) are just as dangerous as new if mismanaged.
4. How to Fix This
Option 1: Use weak_ptr for Non-Owning Links (Recommended)
cpp
Copy
class FMTNode : public std::enable_shared_from_this<FMTNode> {
    std::weak_ptr<FMTNode> parent_;  // Safe non-owning reference
    std::vector<std::weak_ptr<FMTNode>> children_;  // No dangling pointers!
public:
    void setParent(std::shared_ptr<FMTNode> parent) {
        parent_ = parent;
        if (auto p = parent_.lock()) {
            p->children_.push_back(shared_from_this());  // Safe!
        }
    }
};
Pros: Automatically handles dangling pointers.

Cons: Slight performance overhead (negligible in most cases).

Option 2: Manually Break Links Before tree_.clear()
cpp
Copy
void clearTree() {
    // Step 1: Nullify all raw pointers
    for (auto& node : tree_) {
        node->parent_ = nullptr;
        node->children_.clear();
    }
    // Step 2: Now safe to clear
    tree_.clear();
}
Pros: No overhead.

Cons: Easy to forget, risky in multithreaded code.

Option 3: Use unique_ptr + Raw Pointers (If You Control All Access)
cpp
Copy
std::vector<std::unique_ptr<FMTNode>> tree_;

// Guarantee that `tree_` outlives all node operations.
// Raw pointers are safe if you never dereference them after `tree_.clear()`.
5. Key Takeaways for Future C++ Code
Raw pointers (T*) are unsafe by default. They don’t respect ownership.

Always use smart pointers (shared_ptr, unique_ptr) for ownership.

Use weak_ptr for non-owning references (e.g., parent/child links).

Never assume containers will clean up raw pointers. They don’t.

Tools to detect these issues:

valgrind (memory errors)

AddressSanitizer (-fsanitize=address)

Why This Bites Even Experienced Developers
Hidden assumptions: "I didn’t use new, so I’m safe."

Ownership isn’t enforced by the compiler: C++ trusts you to model it correctly.

Debugging is painful: Crashes happen far from the root cause.

What to Remember
Smart pointers = ownership.

Raw pointers = observation only.

tree_.clear() only cares about shared_ptrs, not raw pointers inside nodes.

This is a critical lesson in C++ memory safety! Now you’ll never mix ownership models blindly.




summary of the problem:
Clearing the vector only destroys the memory owned by the unique or shared pointers. However, if those nodes have pointers to one another (like parent or children pointers), those raw pointers won't be automatically updated or nullified. That means other parts of your code could end up referencing invalid memory. The disconnect function is a way to explicitly break those inter-node connections to avoid dangling pointers and undefined behavior.

In short, if no other part of your program keeps a pointer to those nodes (i.e., the tree is the sole owner), you might not strictly need to call disconnect. However, given that your nodes reference each other as part of a graph structure, it's safer to call disconnect before clearing the vector.


better approach --> 

One way to simplify your design is to use smart pointers to manage ownership and relationships automatically. For example:

Use std::shared_ptr for owning pointers and std::weak_ptr for non-owning (back) references.
Instead of having raw pointers for parent and children, store parent pointers as std::weak_ptr and children as std::shared_ptr (or even std::weak_ptr if appropriate). This avoids circular references and ensures that when the owning container (e.g., your tree_ vector) clears, no dangling pointers remain.

Encapsulate relationships in your node class.
By having your node's destructor automatically handle disconnection (or by relying on the weak pointer mechanism), you remove the need for a manual disconnectFromGraph() call. For example, when a node is destroyed, its weak parent pointer does not prevent the parent's destruction, and vice versa.

Example Refactor
Before:

cpp
Copy
Edit
// Raw pointers leading to manual disconnection
FMTNode* parent_;
std::vector<FMTNode*> children_;
After:

cpp
Copy
Edit
#include <memory>
#include <vector>

class FMTNode : public std::enable_shared_from_this<FMTNode> {
public:
    std::weak_ptr<FMTNode> parent_;
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<FMTNode>> children_;

    // Other members and methods
};
With this setup:

When the tree_ vector (which holds std::shared_ptr<FMTNode>) is cleared, each node is automatically destroyed.

The parent pointers, being weak, do not extend the lifetime of their children, and the children pointers being shared_ptr ensure that the children are kept alive only if they are owned elsewhere.

Benefits
Automatic Memory Management:
Smart pointers automatically clean up memory when no longer needed.

No Need for Manual Disconnection:
The weak pointers prevent dangling references without requiring an explicit disconnect function.

Safer Code:
It reduces the chance of memory leaks, double frees, or dangling pointers, as ownership is clearly defined.

This design change shifts the responsibility of memory management to the smart pointer mechanism, which can significantly reduce the potential for errors and simplify your cleanup code.


-----------------

why my condtion works?

The proof is built on the optimality property of Dijkstra’s algorithm and the priority queue ordering. Once a node’s cost is finalized, no other node can offer a better (cheaper) path to it because:
The algorithm only processes nodes in increasing order of cost.
The algorithm guarantees that when a node’s cost is finalized, it is the smallest possible cost.
Thus, mathematically speaking, once 𝑥
x’s cost has been finalized via z3 ​
 , the condition for updating 
x’s cost via z2 ​
will not be satisfied because no path through z2
can provide a cheaper cost than the path through z3​
even though the cost to root of z2 is less than cost to root of z3! (because the edge distance to z2 is longer than to z3)

The isTrajectorySafe function is working as intended and is correctly using the 0.5 inflation during planning. The issue you're seeing is not a bug in that function, but rather a fundamental challenge of planning in an environment with moving obstacles.

The collisions happen in the small gap between what the planner predicted would be safe and what actually happens when the robot executes the path a fraction of a second later.

The Core Reason: Planning vs. Reality
Planning Time: When isTrajectorySafe is called inside the plan() function, it looks at a potential path segment. It predicts where all dynamic obstacles will be at the future time that the robot would traverse that segment. It then checks if the robot's 0.5m inflated radius will collide with any obstacle's inflated radius at that future time. If it finds a path where all segments are "safe" according to these predictions, it returns that path.

Execution Time: A few milliseconds later, the simulationLoop begins to move your robot along that "safe" path. However, in those few milliseconds, the real dynamic obstacles may have moved slightly differently than the planner's Kalman Filter predicted. This small prediction error can be enough to erode the 0.5m safety buffer, causing the robot's true physical footprint to collide with an obstacle's true footprint.

Key Factors Causing This Discrepancy
Dynamic Obstacle Prediction Error: The Kalman Filter provides a best guess based on an object's past movement, but it cannot perfectly predict the future. If an obstacle suddenly changes direction or speed, the prediction will be wrong. Your 0.5m inflation is your budget to absorb this prediction error. A collision means the prediction error was larger than your 0.5m budget on that frame.

The "Bridge Trajectory": The planner computes an optimal path between nodes in its graph. However, your robot's continuous real-time position is almost never perfectly on one of those nodes. A "bridge" trajectory is created on-the-fly to connect your robot's current position to the nearest "safe" node on the planned path. While this bridge is also checked for safety, it is generated after the main plan is optimized and is the most vulnerable part of the path to changes in the environment.

Replanning Latency: There is a very short delay between the moment an obstacle invalidates the current path and the moment a new path is computed and sent to the simulation. During this latency, the robot continues to follow the old, now-unsafe path, which can lead to a collision.

In summary, you are seeing the safety margin get "used up" by the unpredictability of the dynamic world. The planner is correctly avoiding paths it knows will be unsafe, but it cannot have perfect knowledge of the future.
